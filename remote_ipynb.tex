\section{Introduction}
\subsection{What is this?}

The \href{http://jupyter.org/}{Jupyter Notebook}~(previously IPython Notebook)~provides a feature-rich~interactive environment for learning and using the \href{https://www.python.org/}{Python Programming language}.
If you're studying for a BSc or MSc at the University College London Department of Geography then it's likely that you've encountered these Notebooks in one or more of your modules or in the preparation of a dissertation.
Usually this will be from one of the workstations in Pearson 110a that forms part of the \href{http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/resources/computer-support/teaching-cluster}{Geography Linux Cluster}.
Since physical access to Pearson 110a is not always practical, you may wish to have direct access to these files from another computer.
This guide will show you how to \emph{remotely} run and work with Jupyter Notebooks hosted on the Linux Cluster in a manner that is fast.

\subsection{Preamble on operating systems}

While the machines in Pearson 110A run a~\emph{Linux} OS, it is likely that you use either \emph{Mac OS X} or \emph{Microsoft~Windows} on your own computer. The bulk of this guide is written for somebody using the terminal on a Linux computer, and Apple fans~should be able to enter all these same commands on the~\href{http://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-software/get-more-out-of-os-x-terminal-3608274/}{Mac Terminal}. The \emph{On Windows~}section adapts these instructions for a Windows terminal emulator, although it is important to read \emph{On Linux} first.

However, I strongly urge any Windows users intending on working extensively with Python and Jupyter Notebooks to consider installing a Linux distribution.
Don't be alarmed: this need not be a drastic switch as there are two simple ways to set up Linux \emph{alongside} Windows.
The first is to use a \emph{\href{https://www.howtogeek.com/196060/beginner-geek-how-to-create-and-use-virtual-machines/}{virtual machine}}, an OS that runs \emph{inside} your current system.
This is very simple to setup (see \href{http://www.storagecraft.com/blog/the-dead-simple-guide-to-installing-a-linux-virtual-machine-on-windows/}{here}) and I myself use this method to work from UCL's library computers.
The second option, and the one I use for my personal computer, is~\emph{\href{https://www.howtogeek.com/187789/dual-booting-explained-how-you-can-have-multiple-operating-systems-on-your-computer/}{dual-booting}.}~Although this is somewhat involved, a native Linux install is always faster than a virtual one and there are plenty of guides available online to guide you through the process (e.g. \href{https://itsfoss.com/guide-install-linux-mint-16-dual-boot-windows/}{1} \href{https://www.lifewire.com/ultimate-windows-7-ubuntu-linux-dual-boot-guide-2200653}{2}~\href{https://www.howtogeek.com/214571/how-to-dual-boot-linux-on-your-pc/}{3} \href{http://www.pcworld.com/article/2955460/operating-systems/dual-booting-linux-with-windows-what-you-need-to-know.html}{4}). 
Whichever option you go for, you'll ~need to choose one from among the many \emph{\href{http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major}{distributions}~}of Linux.
\href{https://www.ubuntu.com/download}{Ubuntu}~and~\href{https://linuxmint.com/}{Linux Mint}~are most often suggested for beginners, and I would recommend opting for a more lightweight flavour (featuring MATE, Xfce or LXDE as the desktop environment) for use on a virtual machine or an ageing laptop.

\section{On Linux/ Mac OS X}
\subsection{Manual}

The section provides a very explicit set of instructions to get up and running with remote Jupyter Notebooks.
The listings boxes display commands to be entered into the terminal. \textbf{\textless{}\textgreater{}} enclose values which must be replaced as specified, while comments --- any text after \textbf{\#} --- do not need to be entered.
Since these commands may not always render properly, be careful to distinguish one dash ``-'' from two ``-{}-'' --- it should never be a long dash ``--''!
If you're familiar with the command-line interface then you could skip to section \ref{sec:auto}, where they're condensed to shell functions, but it's probably worth going through this just once to make sure that everything is working smoothly.

\subsubsection{Run Notebook Server}
\label{sec:runnb}

The first step is use the program \href{http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ssh1.html}{Secure Shell (SSH)}~to remotely log into one of the machines in Pearson 110a and start up a Notebook server.
Because of the way the Linux cluster is set up, this requires a two-step (or ``multi-hop'') log in.
To make the first hop, open a new terminal and enter the command in listing \ref{lst:logingw}, replacing \textless{}USER\textgreater{} with your UCL username and~\textless{}GATEWAY\textgreater{} with the name of any one of the gateway servers listed on~\href{http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/resources/computer-support/linux-remote-access}{Geography Remote Access page}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Login to gateway}, label={lst:logingw}]
ssh <USER>@<GATEWAY>.geog.ucl.ac.uk
\end{lstlisting}

After entering your password again, start running the Notebook server with command \ref{lst:runnb}.
The flag ``--no-browser'' prevents Firefox from opening automatically, while ``--port'' tells the server to listen on a particular port number.
This is 8888 by default, although you can choose just about any integer above 1026 to replace \textless{}PORT\textgreater{}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Run Notebook server}, label={lst:runnb}]
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=<PORT>
\end{lstlisting}

Jupyter should now inform you that ``The IPython Notebook is running at: \textless{}link\textgreater{}''.
Without opening the link, check that the port number (after ``http://localhost:'') is the same the one you specified.
If it has changed, simply note down the new number and use it as \textless{}PORT\textgreater{} for all subsequent commands.

\subsubsection{Set up SSH tunnel}

Next, you're going to open a connection to the Notebook server you just created.
In a~\textbf{new} terminal, enter the commands in listings \ref{lst:tunnel1} and \ref{lst:tunnel2}. As before, replace the bracketed values and supply your password when prompted.
This time, the ``-L'' flags tell SSH to use \href{https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding}{local port forwarding}~so that you can transfer data between your computer and the server via an \href{http://blog.trackets.com/2014/05/17/ssh-tunnel-local-and-remote-port-forwarding-explained-with-examples.html}{SSH tunnel}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Tunnel to gateway server}, label={lst:tunnel1}]
ssh -L <PORT>:localhost:<PORT> -N <MACHINE>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Tunnel to machine}, label={lst:tunnel2}]
ssh -L <PORT>:localhost:<PORT> -N <MACHINE>
\end{lstlisting}

If all has gone well, the terminal will appear to be hanging \footnote{The optional ``-N'' flag prevents any more user input} and the SSH tunnel should be open.
To use the Notebook, copy the link produced in section \ref{sec:runnb} (e.g.~\url{http://localhost:8888}) and paste it into the URL bar of your favourite browser. 
Congratulations, you should now be looking at the familiar Jupyter Notebook file browser. 

\subsubsection{Issues}

Occasionally, when trying to set up the SSH tunnel, you will get a message like:
\begin{quote}
bind: Address already in use

channel\emph{setup}fwd\_listener: cannot listen to port: \textless{}PORT\textgreater{}

Could not request local forwarding
\end{quote}

This means that the tunnel could not be established as another process is using that particular port. If this occurs, start everything over again with a different port number.

\subsection{Automatic}
\label{sec:auto}

It will very quickly become tedious to type out these commands perfectly every time you want to run a Notebook remotely.
The two (\href{http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/bash/}{bash})~\href{https://www.shellscript.sh/functions.html}{functions}~below can be used to condense these lines to a few short commands.

\lstinputlisting[caption={Functions to login/tunnel to geography cluster}, label={lst:gfuncs}, firstline=2, lastline=21, breaklines=true]{geog_functions.sh}

The code in listing \ref{lst:gfuncs} does not display properly in a pdf and so will not work as-is. The original file containing these functions can be found at:

\url{https://github.com/stainbank/remote_ipynb/blob/master/geog_functions.sh}

To ``install'' these two functions, open your~\href{http://superuser.com/questions/49289/what-is-the-bashrc-file}{.bashrc}~file (located in the user root directory) with a text editor and paste in the entire code block, making the appropriate replacements to the default values before saving.
If this file doesn't exist, \href{http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/119714}{as is the case on Mac OS X}, simply create it and then add the following line to the file .bash\_profile~(also in the user root directory): 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Source .bashrc}, label={lst:srcbashrc}]
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi
\end{lstlisting}
